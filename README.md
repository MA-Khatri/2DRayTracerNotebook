A basic 2D ray tracer made using google colab, numpy, and matplotlib. Features reflection, refraction, Fresnel terms, and continuous refraction with Luneburg lenses. 
It was designed to showcase light paths that emerge from ray interactions with circular lenses. To view the project, you can either open up the original colab notebook 
and make a copy or clone this repo and open the jupyter notebook to run it locally.
